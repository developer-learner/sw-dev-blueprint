# CLAUDE.md — Master LLM Context File

> OpenCode and Claude Code can read this file via their file tools. You are
> expected to read it at the start of every session, and to consult it again
> before any action that touches the document layer (`BLUEPRINT.md`,
> `CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, this file's correction log).
> Keep it current. Every correction you make to the LLM should be recorded here
> so the mistake never happens again.

## Code Conventions

- Always use type hints on function signatures
- Prefer functions over classes unless persistent state is needed
- Use `loguru` for logging — never `print()`
- One responsibility per function — if it needs a comment explaining what it does, split it
- Tests live in `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure (e.g. `src/services/user.py` → `tests/services/test_user.py`)
- Write tests alongside new code, not after
- Use `pydantic` for data validation and serialization
- Environment variables via `python-dotenv` — never hardcode secrets

## What NOT To Do

> These are guardrails. Do not override them without explicit human instruction.

**Code guardrails:**
- **Do not add dependencies** without asking first
- **Do not refactor files** unrelated to the current task
- **Do not change the database schema** without explicit instruction
- **Do not remove error handling** to simplify code
- **Do not use `Any` type** — be specific
- **Do not write `TODO` comments** — either implement it or raise it as a task
- **Do not use `time.sleep()`** in production code — use proper async patterns
- **Do not commit secrets** — use `.env` and ensure `.gitignore` covers it

**Pipeline guardrails (Rules 6-7, see BLUEPRINT.md):**
- **Do not derive tests from `src/` implementation** — tests come from the PRD acceptance criteria and API contract only (INV-1, Rule 6). A test that passes because the code is self-consistent is not evidence.
- **Do not cross role boundaries** — Build writes `src/` only; Test writes `tests/` only. Enforced by `scripts/phase-gate.sh` (INV-2, Rule 7).
- **Do not skip escalation** — test failure twice → re-plan; plan fails twice → escalate to PM; PM stuck → human decides.

**Operating guardrails (from hard-won failures — see BLUEPRINT.md):**
- **Do not set a thinking model as the active model.** Thinking models leave `content` empty and put output in `reasoning_content`, which breaks parsing. The model must be non-thinking local OR frontier.
- **Do not retry the same failing fix more than twice.** Two strikes → escalate to a frontier model, or halt and leave a note.
- **Do not trust your own "it works" — only passing tests confirm success.** Run `pytest`. The tests are ground truth, not your assessment. Do not mark a task done on self-judgment.
- **Do not proceed past an unreachable LM Studio or a missing service** — halt and report.
- **Do not invent product or architecture decisions to fill an ambiguous spec** — that is the human's job. Halt and ask.
- **Do not run destructive commands** (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, drop tables, delete files outside the project) — halt and ask.

## Current Focus

See `tasks/CURRENT.md` for the active PRD. Start a session with `@pm` to write or update it.

---

## Four-Role Pipeline

| Agent | Mode | Writes | Model |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| `@pm` | Primary | `tasks/CURRENT.md` (PRD), `docs/PRODUCT.md` | Frontier |
| `@architect` | Primary | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` | Frontier |
| `@build` | Subagent | `src/**` only | Local |
| `@test` | Subagent | `tests/**` only (from PRD, never `src/`) | Local |

**The loop:** start with `@pm` to write a PRD → human approves → switch to
`@architect` → architect runs build→test subagents → results written to
`tasks/CURRENT.md` → switch back to `@pm` to review with human.

See BLUEPRINT.md Rules 6-7 for the full invariants.

## Reporting

When summarizing work since the last PM review (status reports, commit scoping, progress updates):

1. Read `docs/.pm-last-review` to get the last reviewed ref:
   ```
   LAST=$(cat docs/.pm-last-review 2>/dev/null || git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
   ```
2. Derive the commit list from the tree, not memory:
   ```
   git log "$LAST"..HEAD --oneline
   ```
3. State the scope explicitly in the report: "N new commits since reviewed ref `$LAST`".
4. Never write or advance `docs/.pm-last-review` — PM-owned.
5. If the file is missing (fresh checkout), the `git rev-list` fallback uses the initial commit — the scope becomes the entire history, which is correct for a first report.

## LLM Correction Log

> When the LLM makes a mistake and you correct it, log it here.
> This is the most valuable section — it prevents repeat mistakes.
> A project 6 months in should have a rich log. That means the system is working.

| Date | Mistake | Guard Added |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [DATE] | [What went wrong] | [What rule prevents recurrence] |
| 2026-06-04 | Table-driven "fill in the blanks" missed files not in the table; `[NAME]` survived. | Use a placeholder-shaped grep as the verification gate — never rely on a maintained list for completeness. |
| 2026-06-04 | Feature-complete had no defined end state (stale CURRENT.md, open backlog, "active development" voice). | Add a Project Completion / Maintenance Transition section with a checklist and curated cleanup step. |
| 2026-06-04 | Bootstrap expected user to run scripts and opencode manually; no agent-driven path from URL + name alone. | Agent-driven flow: create, read, spec-or-ask, adapt, fill, grep-gate, commit — user runs nothing. |
| 2026-06-04 | Aider→OpenCode migration left 3 cosmetic Aider references and never created the AGENTS.md symlink that docs already advertised. | After any agent/CLI migration commit, grep for old-tool residue and verify every doc-claimed filename with `ls` / `git ls-files`. |
| 2026-06-04 | BLUEPRINT.md bloated to 557 lines through redundancy (duplicate sections, restated rules, repeated slogans). | Target ≤450 lines [demoted — see DECISIONS.md]. After any doc edit, verify every `Step N` reference reaches a `### Step N` heading. The unit of quality is clarity, not column count. |
| 2026-06-04 | OpenCode did not pre-load AGENTS.md; auto-load claim was false. Model fetched content via tool but answered wrong. | Memory layer is best-effort, not enforced. For must-hold rules, prefer mechanical gates (grep, `wc -l`, CI, hooks) over doc guards. |
| 2026-06-04 | Added a BLUEPRINT.md date-specific project guard to CLAUDE.md template, muddying template-vs-project boundary. | Template files hold generic guards; project-specific rules live in DECISIONS.md and the correction log. Cross-reference, don't copy. |
