# DECISIONS.md — Architectural Decision Log

> Every non-obvious technical decision goes here with the reasoning.
> This prevents the LLM from "helpfully" undoing choices you already made.
> Format: date, decision, why, what not to suggest.

## Template

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — [Decision title]

**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Alternatives considered:** [What else was evaluated]
**Reason:** [Why this choice was made]
**Do not suggest:** [What the LLM should not propose as a "fix"]
```

## Decisions

## [DATE] — [Your first decision here]

**Decision:** [e.g. Using raw SQL over ORM]
**Alternatives considered:** [e.g. SQLAlchemy, Tortoise ORM]
**Reason:** [e.g. Query complexity made ORM unreadable for our join-heavy patterns]
**Do not suggest:** Switching to an ORM. This was deliberate.

---

## [DATE] — Monorepo structure

**Decision:** Single repository for all services.
**Alternatives considered:** Separate repos per service.
**Reason:** Team size doesn't justify the overhead of managing multiple repos. Shared code is easier to refactor.
**Do not suggest:** Splitting into microservices repos until team grows past 5 engineers.

## 2026-06-04 — Pruned BLUEPRINT.md (557 → ~440 lines)

**Decision:** Apply the noise/redundancy findings from a parallel LLM audit; skip the lifecycle/strategy findings from a second LLM.
**Alternatives considered:** (a) accept both LLMs' suggestions and add new rules; (b) leave the file as-is; (c) full rewrite.
**Reason:** BLUEPRINT.md is the LLM's entry point. Every redundant line is context-window cost and a chance for ambiguity to compound. Pruning is a guardrail against drift, not cosmetics. Adding more rules (the second LLM's "fortify" suggestions: Doc-Sync hard rule, TDD loop, REVIEW checkpoints, `/reset-context`) would partially undo the trim and add bloat.
**Do not suggest:** Re-adding the dropped sections. The "Document Map" alone is sufficient; the verbose "Document Roles Explained" was redundant. "Step 5 — Adapt the stack" is a pointer to Rule 3, not a restatement. Bootstrap cleanup, OpenCode Configuration, and Quick Reference Card are now minimal — keep them so.

**Trimmed (12 items, ~115 lines removed):**
- Dropped "Document Roles Explained" (duplicated Document Map)
- Collapsed Bootstrap Step 5 to a 1-line pointer to Rule 3
- Trimmed Maintenance Contract from 6 rows to 4 (dropped obvious triggers)
- Trimmed Files Never to Touch from 5 items to 3 (universal best-practice items removed)
- Shrunk Bootstrap Step 4 cleanup (24→6 lines)
- Trimmed Step 7 preamble (dropped "Hard Rule 5" restatement)
- Shrunk OpenCode Configuration section (28→3 lines + pointer to `opencode.json`)
- Trimmed anti-pattern "wrong provider name" to a one-liner
- Deleted Quick Reference Card (restated diagram + rules)
- Fixed phantom "Step 4.5" reference on line 490 → "Step 4"
- Reduced duplicate "lms not lmstudio" mentions from 3 to 1
- Reduced "AGENTS.md symlinks to CLAUDE.md" mentions from 5 to 3 (one in prose + 2 short callouts)
